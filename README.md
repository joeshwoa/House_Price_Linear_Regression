# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This project demonstrates the implementation of linear regression, from data preprocessing to training the model and evaluating its performance.

## Overview
The Linear Regression project provides a practical demonstration of how to implement linear regression for both simple and multiple variables. It is designed to help users understand the underlying math, how to fit a model to data, and how to make predictions based on the trained model.

## Features
Data preprocessing: Handle missing data, normalize features, and split data into training and testing sets.

Model training: Fit a linear regression model to the training data.

Model evaluation: Compute metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate model performance.

Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Installation
To run the Linear Regression project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/joeshwoa/Linear-Regression.git```
2. Navigate into the project directory: ```cd Linear-Regression```
3. Install the necessary dependencies: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Run the linear regression script: ```python linear_regression.py```
   
## Usage
Prepare the Data: The project includes a sample dataset, or you can load your own data. Make sure the data is in a CSV format with clearly labeled columns for the features and target variable.

Train the Model: Run the script to train the linear regression model on the dataset. The model will fit a line (or hyperplane) that best represents the relationship between the input features and the target variable.

Evaluate Performance: After training, the script will output key metrics such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the R-squared value to show how well the model fits the data.

Make Predictions: Input new data into the trained model to generate predictions.

## Examples
Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use the Linear Regression project:

Dataset: Suppose you have a dataset with housing prices, where the features include the size of the house and the number of bedrooms.

Model: You fit a linear regression model to predict house prices based on these features.

Prediction: After training, the model can predict the price of a house given its size and number of bedrooms.

Sample code:

````
# Example usage of the linear regression model
from linear_regression import LinearRegressionModel

# Load dataset
data = load_data('housing.csv')

# Train model
model = LinearRegressionModel(data)
model.train()

# Predict
new_data = [[2000, 3]]  # Example input: [house size, number of bedrooms]
predicted_price = model.predict(new_data)
print(f"Predicted price: {predicted_price}")
````
